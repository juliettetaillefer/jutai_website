          <a href="index.html"><span>Bords de Vienne, si vous m'étiez contés...</span></a>
              <p>Perhaps his most famous work was a painting entitled Convergence, which was a collage of
                 colors splattered on a canvas that created masterful shapes and lines that evoke emotions and attack the eye. The painting was created in 1952, and is oil on canvas; 93.5 inches by 155 inches (Karmel, 1999). With Pollock's brushstrokes he was able to make handy use of colors, lines, textures, lights, and contrasting shapes. This painting is enormous and its size can only really be appreciated in person.</p>

          <h2>Number One,  <span>1950</span></h2>
            <p>
            Number One, 1949 embodies the artistic breakthrough Pollock reached
             between 1947 and 1950. It was painted in an old barn-turned-studio next to a small house on the East End of Long Island, where Pollock lived and worked from 1945 on. The property led directly to Accabonac Creek, where eelgrass marshes and gorgeous, watery light were a source of inspiration for him. </p>

          <h2>Lucifer, <span> 1947</span></h2>
            <p> Pollock's freely admitted total retrenchment from traditional methods of oil painting was patently obvious in Lucifer. From the looks of its imagery, Lucifer begun in a similar vein to works of the previous year such as Eyes in the Heat. However, at some point in the process of painting, Pollock laid down his brush and began instead to drip and spatter his pigment, not quite completely covering the underlayer, into which he also embedded small pieces of gravel to increase the texture. </p>

          <h2>The Flame,  <span>1938</span></h2>
              <p> At age eighteen, in early fall of 1930, Jackson Pollock left Los Angeles and went east, bent on becoming an artist. He had very little going for him other than his vocational fixation - his belief that "being an artist is life its self - living it I mean." This unpromising, uncompromising young man only lived about a quarter of a century longer. At his death his art was the most consequential and controversial ever to have been produced by American. Reflecting on the immense success of Pollock's work, his brother Sande offered his thoughts on it beginnings, which might, be said, have prompted a kindly counsellor to suggest a career switch to tennis or plumbing.

          <h2>Mural, <span> 1943</span></h2>
            <p>
            Mural was immediately recognized as a turning point for American art. Art critic Clement Greenberg had written encouraging but less than whole-hearted endorsements in his Pollock reviews, but, he said after he saw the big mural in Guggenheim's townhouse, "I took one look at it and I thought, 'Now that's great art,' and I knew Jackson was the greatest painter this country had produced." From this point on, throughout the forties, Greenberg was a firm advocate of Pollock's art, and in turn Pollock's success canonized Greenberg's judgment. </p>
